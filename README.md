Paradigm was born out of our own frustrations with the institutional OTC trading process.

After spending hundreds of hours trading and navigating the inefficient, multi-channel nature of traditional OTC markets, we thought to ourselves: there has to be a better way.

Paradigm automates bilateral price negotiation and settlement workflows for
institutional digital asset traders. We are building the next generation of institutional OTC trading that is powered by conversation and automated with AI.
